# Group theory
## primitive element
### Proof:
We hope to prove that 
1. The number of primitive elements is the number of coprimes of |G| = &phi;(|G|).
2. If the order or an element is factor of |G|, it's not a primitive element.

Let &prop; &isin; _G_ be a primitive element of group _G_, then we can define any element _x<sub>i</sub>_ &isin; _G_ as:  
_x<sub>i</sub> = f(&prop;, i) = &prop; &omicron; &prop; &omicron; &prop; &omicron; &prop; &omicron; ... &prop; &omicron; &prop; &omicron; &#8195;&#8195; i times_  

- since &prop; is a primitive element, then 1 <= i <= |G|, such that.  
  f(&prop;, i = 1) = &prop;, and f(&prop;, i = |G|) = N.  

An element is primitive if it **reaches N** for the **first time** after **|G| steps.**

1. **if i is a factor of |G|**:  
  _&therefore;&#8195; f(x<sub>i</sub>, ord(x<sub>i</sub>)) = f(&prop;, i * ord(x<sub>i</sub>)) = f(&prop;, |G|) = N_  
  *&therefore;&#8195;  i * ord(x<sub>i</sub>) = |G|*, and i is factor of |G|.  
  *&therefore;&#8195; ord(x<sub>i</sub>) is factor of |G|.*  
  *&because;&#8195; ord(x<sub>i</sub>) < |G|.*  
  ***&therefore;&#8195; x<sub>i</sub> is not a primitive element of G, if |x<sub>i</sub>| is a factor of |G|, and |x<sub>i</sub>| = |G|/i***  

2. **if i is comprime of |G|**:  
  _&therefore;&#8195; f(x<sub>i</sub>, ord(x<sub>i</sub>)) = f(&prop;, i * ord(x<sub>i</sub>)) = f(&prop;, m*|G|) = N._  
  _&because;&#8195; gcd(i, |G|) = 1_  
  _&therefore;&#8195; i*|x<sub>i</sub>| &ne; |G|._  
  _&because;&#8195; x<sub>i</sub> must reach N after |x<sub>i</sub>| steps, the equation would be_  
  &#8195;&#8195;&#8195; _i*|X<sub>i</sub>| = m*|G| where m is an integer constant such that m < |G|_
  _&because;&#8195; i is coprime with |G|_  
  _&therefore;&#8195; |x<sub>i</sub>| >= |G|_ , but |x<sub>i</sub>| <= |G|  
  _&therefore;&#8195; x<sub>i</sub> = |G|_  
  **_&therefore;&#8195; x<sub>i</sub> is a primitive element of group G, if i is coprime with |G|_**  

3. **if i has a common factor with |G|**  
  let f = gcd(i, |G|) >= 1, f < i < |G|.  
  let's consider the group generated by the element x<sub>f</sub> called F.  
  &because; f is a factor of i.  
  &therefore; x<sub>i</sub> &isin; F.  
  &therefore; |x<sub>i</sub>| <= |F| = |G|/f < |G|.  
  **&therefore; X<sub>i</sub> is not a primitive element of group G.**  
  also since x<sub>i</sub> &isin; F, we can compute its order within the subgroup instead which is a maximum of f, depending on the relation between |F| = |G|/f, and j = i/f, where |F| and j are analgous to |G| and i in the original group.

Since the 3 possibilities above cover all possibilities for i.
&therefore; We can conclude that an element X<sub>i</sub> &isin; G is a primitive element iff i is coprimes with |G|.  
&therefore; the number of primitive elements of group G = the number of coprimes of |G| = &phi;(|G|).
