# Chapter 8: Public key cryptography based on Discrete Logarithm Problem

## DLP: Discrete Logarithm Problem
- this is the one way function based on which many cryptography schemes are made including but not limited to the ones mentioned here.
- **Problem Statement**: Given two numbers *&vprop;* and *&#946;* find a number x such that ***&vprop;^x = &#946; mod p*** where *p* is a chosen prime 
number.

It's easy to compute *beta* given *alpha* and *x*, but computing the *logarithm x = log*alpha*(*beta*)* is the hard problem.
